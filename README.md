## Supported Features
- Support for No MBC, MBC1 and MBC3 (no support for RTC yet) games.
- Support for battery-backed SRAM (but saving to FRAM currently doesn't work).
- Can only play the one game programmed in at compile time.

## Proposed Features

- Supports the Game Boy (DMG), Game Boy Pocket (MGB), Game Boy Color (CGB), and the Game Boy Advance (AGB) in Game Boy Color mode only.
- Real Time Clock (RTC) with battery backup.
- FRAM 32KiB for save support.
- NOR Flash 16MiB with support upto 8MiB ROM size.
- Support multiple games on NOR Flash.
- USB-C firmware upgrade support.
- USB-C flash storage explorer to store and retrieve save files and ROMs.
- USB-C networking support.

### Flash Storage
The flash storage will be partitioned to allow the user to either support large ROM sizes or increased number of ROMs stored. By setting the maximum ROM size to a smaller value, there will be more space to store other ROMs on the *Storage* partition. An example partition scheme is shown below.

| Partition | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|  --: |---------|
| Firmware | 256KiB | Stores firmware for the RP2040 |
| Storage | Remainder | Wear-levelling filesystem holding ROMs and save files |

### USB-C Networking

By utilising RP2040 and TinyUSB features, the USB-C port can act as a networking device, which when attached to a host, will allow the RP2040 to connect to the Internet. Future features will allow supported Game Boy games to make connections to the internet.

## Notes
BOM is optimised for purchase from JLCPCB with SMT assembly. The cost of producing a single cart of this revision is approximately Â£15. This version of the PCB has major errors that can be seen in the [errata.md](https://github.com/deltabeard/DBGC/blob/master/errata.md) document. Do not manufacture PCB version 0.3 or below; instead wait for the next version or the one on the master branch.

# Showcase

- [Pokemon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal). An 
  major fan-made upgrade to Pokemon Crystal. Uses MBC3 with battery backed 
  SRAM and Real Time Clock. The version tested had CGB double-speed disabled,
  which caused minor graphical glitches within the game. DBGC does not 
  currently support double-speed, so using it to play Polished Crystal will 
  not result in the intended experience. Non-volatile saving does not 
  currently work (save data is erased on power off).

- Mega Man 1. This commercial game uses MBC1 ROM banking.

- [2048-gb](https://github.com/Sanqui/2048-gb). Open source homebrew game. 
  Uses no ROM banking.
